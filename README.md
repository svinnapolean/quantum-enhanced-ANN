# quantum-enhanced-ANN-
This implementation demonstrates how to enhance your original ANN with **quantum mechanics simulation** to create training data that incorporates quantum effects like **superposition**, **entanglement**, **interference**, and **measurement**. Your existing ANN architecture learns from quantum-generated data.
