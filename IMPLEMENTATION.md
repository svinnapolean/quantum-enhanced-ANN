## Quantum Effects Explained

### Superposition 🌊
Quantum states can exist in multiple states simultaneously. In our implementation:
- Equal probability across states: `|ψ⟩ = (1/√n)|0⟩ + (1/√n)|1⟩ + ... + (1/√n)|n-1⟩`
- Creates diverse probability distributions in training data
- Measured states collapse to classical values

### Entanglement 🔗
Quantum states become correlated such that measuring one affects the other:
- Creates non-classical correlations between features
- Implemented as maximally entangled states
- Features from entangled pairs show statistical dependencies

### Interference 〰️
Wave-like behavior where quantum amplitudes combine:
- Constructive interference (phase = 0): amplitudes add
- Destructive interference (phase = π): amplitudes cancel
- Creates complex patterns in the data distribution

### Measurement 📊
Quantum states collapse to classical values:
- Probability = |amplitude|²
- Introduces fundamental quantum randomness
- Different from classical pseudo-random numbers

## How It Works

1. **Quantum State Preparation**
   ```
   Create superposition → Apply phases → Introduce entanglement
   ```

2. **Measurement & Data Generation**
   ```
   Measure quantum states → Convert to features → Generate labels
   ```

3. **Classical Learning**
   ```
   Train ANN → Learn patterns → Evaluate performance
   ```

## Technical Details

### Quantum State Representation
- States represented as complex amplitude vectors
- Normalization: Σ|αᵢ|² = 1
- Measurement probability: P(i) = |αᵢ|²

### Neural Network Architecture
- Input layer: matches feature dimension
- Hidden layers: configurable (e.g., 16, 8)
- Output layer: single neuron for binary classification
- Activation: tanh for hidden, sigmoid for output

### Training Process
- Optimizer: Mini-batch gradient descent
- Loss: Binary cross-entropy
- Backpropagation through all layers
- Learning rate: typically 0.1

## Usage Patterns

### Quick Start
```python
from quantum_simulator import QuantumDataGenerator
from neural_network import NeuralNetwork

# Generate data
gen = QuantumDataGenerator()
X, y = gen.generate_quantum_enhanced_dataset(1000, 10)

# Train network
nn = NeuralNetwork([10, 16, 1], learning_rate=0.1)
nn.train(X, y, epochs=100)
```

### Individual Quantum Effects
```python
from quantum_simulator import QuantumSimulator

sim = QuantumSimulator()
state = sim.create_superposition(4)
measurement = state.measure()
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Data Generation**: O(n_samples × n_features)
- **Training**: O(epochs × n_samples × Σ(layer_i × layer_i+1))
